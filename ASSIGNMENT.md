# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned how to use the library based on how I used the Java libraries from previous programming courses I have taken. I learned how to write the examples based on lecture material and learning how the module is connected to the unfamiliar API i was working with.
One aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand was the fact that the variables and constructors were fairly relevant to the code's logic. Specifically, the way that these things were named in the code informed me that this was a game that has to do with rolling dice. 
One thing that would have made it easier is if the code included more comments about abstraction, but I did that as part of the assignment's requirements.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> The comments that raise the level of abstraction go beyond what is happening in the code and explain to someone who isn't familiar with coding what is happening on a conceptual level. It helps identify what is happening in the program, rather than what is coded/written.
I would tell a new student in CS142 to remain concise in the manner in which they post their comments and to make sure that someone who is not a developer understands what is happening in the code that is written. I would advise them to also raise the level of abstraction.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me 7.5 hours to finish this assignment.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received help from StackOverflow, the npm package library examples, w3 schools, and Max O'Neal.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I would advise to the instructor that this should be the first week's assignment in the quarter so that future students can practice 'good commenting' techniques early on and so that they can apply what they learned to better
help them comment later code they will write in the class. I did not encounter any problems, but one thing that would make the assignment better is if you had the students add to the logic inside the index.js or main.js files.
